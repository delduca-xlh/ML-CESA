  "reasoning": "Gross margins expected to stabilize around 55% as AI infrastructure costs level off but remain elevated. Net margins forecasted to gradually recover from Q8 low of 20.1% to average 22% as AI monetization improves and operational leverage returns. EBIT margins should recover modestly to 26% from recent 24.8% low. CapEx/revenue elevated at 11% vs historical 8-9% due to continued AI infrastructure investments. Retention ratio improving slightly to 30% from 25.8% as company moderates buyback pace while maintaining growth investments. Key risks include continued margin pressure from AI competition and regulatory headwinds.",
