  "llm_reasoning": "Projections reflect Apple's strong seasonal Q1 pattern (holiday iPhone sales), followed by typical sequential decline in Q2-Q3, with Q4 recovery ahead of new product launches. Slight revenue growth year-over-year driven by Services expansion and emerging market penetration, while maintaining historical gross margin profile around 43-44%. Balance sheet growth reflects continued cash generation and strategic investments."
